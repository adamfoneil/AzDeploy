This provides a really simple continuous deployment mechanism for WinForms apps, building and deploying an installer package to Azure blob storage. It also provides a complementary Nuget package **AO.AzDeploy.Client** used to enable applications to check for updated installers, and download and launch them if available. This is a reboot of my [AzureDeploy](https://github.com/adamosoftware/AzureDeploy) project to simplify and refactor some dependencies.
